There are no extra dependencies or special compile instructions that deviate from the assignment spec.
The basic instructions from the spec are incuded below:

To compile the rpc library and the binder:
`make` (or `make debug` to include debugging flags)

To compile the test code (test client and test server):
`make test`

Run the binder:
`./binder`

Set environment variables printed out by the binder.

Run the server:
`./server`

Run the client:
`./client`
